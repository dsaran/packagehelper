Bugs:
* drag and drop on filetree does not update model.
    * now it updates when moving INTO but no before and after
    * It is necessary to create tests for other drags
* Problem with SVN URL under windows
* It cannot reprocess repository:
"""-->  Exported revision 10102.

svn: Destination directory exists; please remove the directory or use --force to overwrite
svn: '/tmp/TST3/VIVO52_NFO_FINAL' already exists
"""

Interface:
* Help messages
* Show feedback while processing package (now the screen freezes until it is finished)
* Display result from CVS while it is running
* Turn UI into a wizard
* Display Script organization before writing to files (OK)
* Minerva integration
* Add a new step after the manage files step to write files to filesystem and display created scripts

Parser:
* Add support to  "insert as select"
* Complete the grammar for select statements (using, having, order, group, etc)
* Allow parenthesis on where clause
* Parsing full packages broken
