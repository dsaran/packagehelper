Bugs:
* problem tagging package data: "svn: Cannot mix repository and working copy sources"


Interface:
* Display result from CVS while it is running:
 * Performance problem writing directly to textview, need another way to display progress of checkout.
* Minerva integration

Parser:
* Add support to  "insert as select"
* Complete the grammar for select statements (using, having, order, group, etc)
* Allow parenthesis on where clause
* Parsing full packages broken

* change date property of Release object to datetime (how to convert from string ?)
